This is a first-run setup script for an SD card installation of Android
for the Nook Color, along with scripts to run it on recovery boot and
tools for creating such SD cards.

== Building the first-run setup OTA package ==

You will need a GNU/Linux toolchain for ARM (an Android toolchain will
not do).  CodeSourcery has GNU/Linux cross compiler toolchains for ARM
available for download; you can also use Emdebian toolchains, or (if you
have a Linux install/chroot on an ARM box) a native ARM toolchain.

You will also need a copy of the dosfstools source:
http://daniel-baumann.ch/software/dosfstools/

1. Unpack (or git clone) the dosfstools source somewhere.
2. Run make:

   CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- DOSFSTOOLS_SRC=/path/to/dosfstools make

   (Replace the value of DOSFSTOOLS_SRC with the location of the
   unpacked dosfstools source.  CROSS_COMPILE should be set to the
   common prefix of your cross toolchain's tools: for example, if your
   cross compiler is /path/to/toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc, then set
   CROSS_COMPILE to /path/to/toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabi- .)

   You'll get an unpacked Android OTA under out/ .
3. Zip up everything under out/, and use SignApk to sign the resulting
   file:

   cd out
   zip -r ../out.zip .
   cd ..
   java -jar signapk.jar -w /path/to/android/source/tree/build/target/product/security/testkey.x509.pem /path/to/android/source/tree/build/target/product/security/testkey.pk8 out.zip sdcard-first-run.zip
